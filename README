<h2>Project-Scope</h2>
<p>This was my first web scraper project using the Python language in Visual Studio Code. This tool was originally developed as a class used in the first step of building food and drink recipe url databases that are stored for each "query" variable. The next step is to build a class of extractors to navigate to the urls and extract recipe information through dynamic and static content, then dump the specific recipe objects for each culture/region/type of food into another bucket. The databases will eventually be used to create a "Recipe Fusionator", but it can be used to search and store other urls just by changing the "query = ____________" global variable</p>
